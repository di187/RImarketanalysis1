Overview Of Car Brake Pads Market

This report studies the Car Brake Pads market, Brake Pads are components of brake systems used in automotive and other applications. Brake pads are friction materials which bound to the surface that faces the brake rotor and take the brunt of the frictional force necessary to stop the car. In a disc brake system, the brake pedal activates a hydraulic line which squeezes the calipers against the rotors of the cars tires. Pads are positioned between the calipers and the rotors to absorb the energy and heat, and then provide enough grips to stop the car. 

Brake pads are often described as brake linings or brake shoes and when applied to the brake rotors or drums, respectively, with a mix of hydraulic and mechanical force, supply the friction to safely bring the car to a halt. Brake pads are usually used in disc brake setups within a hydraulic brake caliper and are squeezed versus the brake disc, or rotor in order to stop the car when using the brakes. In this report, brake pads, brake linings and brake shoes are in the scope of our statistics.
